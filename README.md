# Tripadvisor Clone with New Features

## Challenge Overview
In this challenge, I replicated the functionality of the popular **Tripadvisor** website, focusing on coding perfection while also introducing new and innovative features that improve user experience.

### Features
- **2D World Map**: 
  - Added an interactive 2D map of the world, where users can click on any country to view famous destinations within that country. This feature enhances awareness of lesser-known places and allows users to easily discover new travel destinations.

- **Pop-up Description for Trip Plans**: 
  - Implemented a hover-over feature that displays a brief description of a trip or plan when the user hovers over it. This allows users to quickly preview trip details without having to click into the plan, making the browsing experience faster and more efficient.

- **Light/Dark Mode Toggle**: 
  - Introduced a toggle button that lets users switch between **Light** and **Dark** modes. This customization ensures a comfortable browsing experience in different lighting conditions and caters to user preferences.
